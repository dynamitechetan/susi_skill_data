# skill categories
This path contains skill groups which we call a 'category'
A skill is a collection of intents for each language. Skills can be bundled into a skill category.
The skill categories are the subdirectories here.
In each of the containing skill category subdirectories you find paths for a language in ISO 639-2 code.
Each of those language subdirectories can contain a skill. A skill is a file with a set of intents.
